# Blockus Distributed Gaming System

## System Components

### 1. Game State Management
- **State Representation**
  - Comprehensive JSON state object containing:
    ```json
    {
      "gameId": "unique-game-identifier",
      "players": [
        {
          "playerId": "player-uuid",
          "color": "blue|red|green|yellow",
          "remainingPieces": [],
          "placedPieces": []
        }
      ],
      "board": {
        "grid": [],
        "occupiedCells": []
      },
      "currentTurn": "player-uuid",
      "gameStatus": "WAITING|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED"
    }
    ```

### 2. Messaging Infrastructure
- **Apache Kafka Integration**
  - Topics:
    1. `blockus-game-events`
    2. `blockus-player-moves`
    3. `blockus-game-state`
  - Event Types:
    - Game Start
    - Player Move
    - Piece Placement
    - Game End
    - Error Events

### 3. Backend Services (Spring Boot)
- **Game Orchestration Service**
  - Manages game lifecycle
  - Validates moves
  - Updates game state
  - Broadcasts events via Kafka

- **Move Validation Microservice**
  - Complex move validation logic
  - Rules engine for Blockus game rules
  - Checks piece placement legality

### 4. Frontend Replay Client (Angular)
- **Replay Functionality**
  - Load game transcript
  - Step-by-step move replay
  - Visualization of board state changes
  - Timeline of moves
  - Player action tracking

### 5. Transcript Management
- **Transcript Generation**
  - Capture all game events
  - Store as structured JSON
  - Downloadable format
  - Includes:
    - Timestamp
    - Player
    - Move details
    - Board state before/after move

## System Flow
1. Game Initialization
   - Players join game
   - Initial state broadcast
   - Game start event

2. Gameplay Cycle
   - Player makes move
   - Move sent to Kafka topic
   - Validation service checks move
   - State updated and broadcast
   - Next player notified

3. Replay Mechanism
   - Transcript downloaded
   - Angular client loads transcript
   - Reconstructs game step by step
   - Allows forward/backward navigation

## Technologies
- Backend: Spring Boot
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- Frontend: Angular
- State Management: Reactive Streams
- Validation: Custom Rules Engine

## Key Considerations
- Distributed system resilience
- Event sourcing principles
- Real-time state synchronization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Scalable game state management

## Potential Enhancements
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Machine learning move prediction
- Multiplayer lobby system
- Replay sharing mechanism
